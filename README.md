# Assignment 12 - Star Network

Consider a star network, where a single node is connected to `N-1` degree-one nodes. Assume that `N` is much larger than 1.  Your goal is to compute the degree correlation coefficient of this network as a function of `N`, using [Formulas 7.11 and 7.12 in Box 7.2](http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/7#measuring-degree) of the adopted book, following the steps:

- (a) compute the numerator of 7.11;
- (b) compute the denominator of 7.11 using 7.12;
- (c) divide the result of (a) by the result of (b).

Please hand in your work as a PDF file explaining all the steps.
